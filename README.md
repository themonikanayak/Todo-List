# Todo-List

• This is an online todo list app where you can create your To-Do list, cross out what you've done and delete them and add new tasks.

• There are some hidden pages where you can navigate by adding "/name" where name is the name of the todo list you want to navigate to.

• I created and styled this webapp using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used Node.js and MongoDB for developing the back-end of the web app.

• This webapp is deployed on Heroku with its database on MongoDB Atlas.
